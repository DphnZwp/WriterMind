# WriterMind üñäÔ∏èüß†
***Website against procrastination and writer‚Äôs block.***

The purpose of this website is to get more discipline to write. You can choose challenges for your documents to get you in the right mindspace and get your work done. You can use the app for writing books, homework or other projects where you need to write.

## Writer‚Äôs Block

Writer's block is the temporary inability of a writer or composer to write. 

## Challenges

In the app you can create challenges for yourself. 
### Challenges
* Setting how many words you want to write. Maximum and minimum number of words.

You can also set a deadline for yourself so that you know when your document must be completed.

## Doelgroep
My target groups are young people and writers who suffer from procrastination.
